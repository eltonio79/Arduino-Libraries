   This example is compatible with hardware board version 1c.

   It demonstrates the minimal amount of code and setup to take a reading
   using temperature compensation and an outside source of temperature.

  // the actual temperature of the solution, as provided by some other source of temperature
  // other than the sensor attached to the board. This allows you to only have one temperature
  // sensor attached to the controller.
