 * This is the sample code for Gravity: Analog pH Sensor / Meter Kit V2, SKU:SEN0161-V2
 * In order to guarantee precision, a temperature sensor such as DS18B20 is needed, to execute automatic temperature compensation.
 * You can send commands in the serial monitor to execute the calibration.
 * Serial Commands:
 *   enterph -> enter the calibration mode
 *   calph   -> calibrate with the standard buffer solution, two buffer solutions(4.0 and 7.0) will be automaticlly recognized
 *   exitph  -> save the calibrated parameters and exit from calibration mode
